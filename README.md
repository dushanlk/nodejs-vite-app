# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Contribution

### Commit message format `type(scope): description`

Possible types are as follows:

* fix: For bug fixes
* feat: For new features
* refactor: For restructuring the code without adding features or fixing bugs
* build: For changes in the build system or dependencies
* ci: For changes in the CI/CD configuration
* docs: For changes in the documentation only
* perf: For performance optimizations
* style: For fixing code formatting
* test: For adding or adjusting tests

The scope is optional and best used in a monorepo to specify that changes were made to a certain app or library within it.
